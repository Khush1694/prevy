# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

  sample_group:
    name: "Your group"
    description: >
      <p>Welcome to %{user_name}'s group!</p>
      <p>This is how your group could look like. Once you have your group, you can:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>
      Send the group link to the people you want so they can request membership
      </li>
      <li>Create events that would only be seen by your group members</li>
      <li>Add organizer role to whomever you want, or to all by default!</li>
      <li>Make the group hidden so that it doesn't appear in groups listing</li>
      </ul>
    location: "The Internet"

  sample_event:
    title: "Your event"
    description: >
      <p>This is how your event could look like.</p>
      <p>When you create an event all members of the group receive a notification email.</p>
      <p>Event attendees will receive an email if the event's start date, end date or address is updated.</p>
      <p>Using the address provided, the event is automatically located in a nice map that you can see below, or by clicking on the event location.</p>
      <p>If the event has a website you can add it too, but that's optional :)</p>
    website: "www.youreventwebsite.com"
