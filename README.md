# Prevy

The idea behind Prevy is to build private communities that revolve around private events.

## Features

- Everything is *private* by default
- Groups can be *hidden*
- People need to *request membership* or *be invited* to become group members
- Only *members* and *invitees* can see hidden groups
- Only *members* and *invitees* can see a group's contents
- Every group has its own *forum*, to discuss anything comfortably
- Group members are rewarded with *points* for commenting, creating topics, and attending events
- All members of a group can be set as organizers by default
- In-app and email notifications

---

*Work in progress*.
