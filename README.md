# Prevy

## Private Communities Around Events

1. All groups are *private* and can be *hidden* (so only the people you want can see them).

2. People need to *request membership* to your groups.

3. Events are *only visible* to group members.

4. Every group has its own *forum*, to discuss anything comfortably.

*Work in progress*.
