  body: "I finally invent something that works!"

-
  body: "I had a horrible nightmare. I dreamed that I went... back in time. It was terrible."

-
  body: "I'm from the future. I came here in a Time Machine that you invented. Now I need your help to get back to the year 1985."

-
  body: "I've had enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy!"

-
  body: "Next saturday night we're sending you back to the future!"

-
  body: "No! It requires something with a little more kick...plutonium!"

-
  body: "No! Marty! We've already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!"

-
  body: "Okay. Time circuit's on. Flux capacitor, fluxing. Engine running. All right."

-
  body: "Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads."

-
  body: "See you in about 30 years."

-
  body: "The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style?"

-
  body: "There's that word again. 'Heavy.' Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?"

-
  body: "Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Ah... Are you telling me that you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?"

-
  body: "Who's President of the United States in 1985? Ronald Reagan? The actor? Ha! Then whose vice president? Jerry Lewis?"

  body: "Hello, IT. Have you tried turning it off and on again?"

-
  body: "Hello, IT. Ya ha? Have you tried forcing an unexpected reboot?"

-
  body: "Ugh, OK, well the button on the side, is it glowing?... Yeah, you need to turn it on. Erm, the button turns it on. Yeah, you... you do know how a button works don't you? No, not on clothes."

-
  body: "See. the driver hooks the function by patching the system call table, so it's not safe to unload it unless another thread's about to jump in and do its stuff, and you don't want to end up in the middle of invalid memory... Hello?"

-
  body: "Didn't know what a stress machine as this morning, and now we have two of them."

-
  body: "Now, let's see what we have here. 'Stand upright.' Well now I can't read it. Oh, not me. I AM a giddy goat."

-
  body: "Would I blow everyone's mind if I ate dessert first?"

-
  body: "So, what brings you to my lair? Not that I'm some sort of animal. Or, or maybe I am."

-
  body: "My middle name is ready. No, that doesn't sound right. I eat ready for breakfast."

-
  body: "Fire. Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to inform you of a fire that has broken out on the premises of 123 Cavendon Road... no, that's too formal. Fire - exclamation mark - fire - exclamation mark - help me - exclamation mark. 123 Cavendon Road. Looking forward to hearing from you. Yours truly, Maurice Moss."

-
  body: "I don't like goat's anything. I don't like goats being involved in any stage of the food production process."

-
  body: "Team! Team, team, team, team, team! I even love saying the word 'team'. You probably think that's a picture of my family. Uh uh. It's the A-Team! Bodie, Doyle, Tiger, the Jewellery Man."

-
  body: "Oh, it's just water. Sometimes I get a hot ear, and this helps cool it down. She is quite the oddball."

-
  body: "I hope this doesn't embarrass you, Jen, but I find the best thing to do with a new employee is to size them up with a long, hard stare..."

-
  body: "Ah! The IT-department. Run by a dynamic go-getter, a genius and a man from Ireland."

-
  body: "You best put seat belts on your ears, Roy, 'cause I'm going to take them for the ride of their life!"

-
  body: "I'm a 32 year old IT consultant who works in the basement. Yes, I do the whole lonely hearts thing."

-
  body: "Nice screensaver. I love the way the smoke seems to be coming off the top of it..."

-
  body: "A plan. Let me put on my slightly larger glasses."

-
  body: "Never been. But I've always liked the idea of the theatre. The smell of the grease, the roar of the paint. I've often thought if I hadn't ended up in computers, I would've gone into the theatre."

-
  body: "If this evening is going to work in any way, you need to pretend to be normal people, yeah? Keep the conversation about things that would interest everybody. You know, nothing about memory, or RAM."

-
  body: "Roy, I spoke to the Elders of the Internet not one hour ago. I told them about Jen winning Employee of the Month and they were so impressed that they wanted to do whatever they could to help."

-
  body: "Well, I'm the boss... Head Honcho. El Numero Uno. Mr. Big. The Godfather. Lord of the Rings. The Bourne... Identity. Er... Taxi Driver. Jaws. I forgot the question quite a while back. Who are you, again?"

-
  body: "Yes! Yesterday's jam. That is what we are to them! Actually, that doesn't work as a thing, because, you know, jam lasts for ages."

-
  body: "Did you notice how she didn't even get excited when she saw this original ZX81?"

-
  body: "With all due respect John, I am the head of IT and I have it on good authority that if you type 'Google' into Google, you can break the Internet. So please, no one try it, even for a joke. It's not a laughing matter. You can break the Internet."

-
  body: "You want me to open it. That's why you called me all the way up here, to open your laptop?"

-
  body: "Just promise me we won't do anything else with them. I want to go back to being weird. I like being weird. Weird is all I've got. That and my sweet style."

-
  body: "Balloons explode, Jen. They explode suddenly, and unexpectedly. They are filled with the capacity to give me a little fright, and I find that unbearable."

-
  body: "I came here to drink milk and kick ass. And I've just finished my milk."

  body: "I firmly believe we can only achieve greatness if first, we achieve goodness"

-
  body: "It's weird. They always travel in groups of five. These programmers, there's always a tall, skinny white guy; short, skinny Asian guy; fat guy with a ponytail; some guy with crazy facial hair; and then an East Indian guy. It's like they trade guys until they all have the right group."

  body: "Compromise is the shared hypotenuse of the conjoined triangles of success."

-
  body: "Gentlemen, I just paid the palapa contractor. The palapa piper, so to speak. The dream is a reality. We'll no longer be exposed... to the elements."

-
  body: "I was gonna sleep last night, but, uh... I thought I had this solve for this computational trust issue I've been working on, but it turns out, I didn't have a solve. But it was too late. I had already drank the whole pot of coffee."

-
  body: "I extended my compression algorithm to support... get this... 12-bit color. Okay, so our users will be able to experience a 10 percent increase in image quality with absolutely no increase in server load whatsoever. Just-Just-Just... Just watch this. Before. After. Before. After."

-
  body: "You listen to me, you muscle-bound handsome Adonis: tech is reserved for people like me, okay? The freaks, the weirdos, the misfits, the geeks, the dweebs, the dorks! Not you!"

-
  body: "We not only think outside of the box, we think outside of the box that box is in - and so on - until innovation is free of all boxes that would contain and constrain it."

  body: "There are a lot of little reasons why the big things in our lives happen."

-
  body: "Look, you can’t design your life like a building. It doesn’t work that way. You just have to live it... and it’ll design itself."

  body: "The trouble with having an open mind, of course, is that people will insist on coming along and trying to put things in it."

-
  body: "Some humans would do anything to see if it was possible to do it. If you put a large switch in some cave somewhere, with a sign on it saying 'End-of-the-World Switch. PLEASE DO NOT TOUCH', the paint wouldn't even have time to dry."

  body: "Stories of imagination tend to upset those without one."

  body: "The whole of life is just like watching a film. Only it's as though you always get in ten minutes after the big picture has started, and no-one will tell you the plot, so you have to work it out all yourself from the clues."

-
  body: "It's still magic even if you know how it's done."

-
  body: "Personal’s not the same as important. People just think it is."

  body: "We are here and it is now. The way I see it is, after that, everything tends towards guesswork."

  body: "Never build a dungeon you wouldn't be happy to spend the night in yourself. The world would be a happier place if more people remembered that."

-
  body: "The world is a globe — the farther you sail, the closer to home you are."

  body: "It's vital to remember who you really are. It's very important. It isn't a good idea to rely on other people or things to do it for you, you see. They always get it wrong."

-
  body: "The trouble with life was that you didn’t get a chance to practice before doing it for real."
