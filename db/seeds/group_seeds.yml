    This is a group for people interested in lucid dreaming from an ethical point of view.

    Cape Town Chess is purely about relaxed social chess. There is no money involved. We are not an official chess club and we don’t keep score.

    What we like most of all is to be the cause of a dormant chess player starting to re-learn the game and play semi-regularly again. We try to do this by way of a pleasant new social aspect to chess.
    <br><br>
    We are willing to get outside of our comfort zone and we try to be good losers. Remember that social chess is sometimes about giving your opponent a break, like some extra time or an encouraging word.
    <br><br>
    Don't worry, if you know how to play, you are good enough.
