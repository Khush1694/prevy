  description: |-
    Code & tea is an informal get together to write some code Friday morning. There are no requirements other than the willingness to sit down, pair up, and learn something new. We're going with mornings because the evenings are full enough as it is. Why add to the chaos of user groups, soccer games, and lawn mowing?

  name: Lucid Dreamers
  description: |-
    This is a group for people interested in lucid dreaming from an ethical point of view. Lucid dreaming doesn't just mean you have nice clear dreams - it means being consciously aware that you are having a dream, and learning how to take charge of the experience. All skill levels are welcome. Let's get together and help each other have amazing experiences, and learn more about ourselves and our inner worlds.
    <br><br>
    Lucid dreaming has many benefits, particularly self-healing - whether physical or psychological problems exist - and it offers the chance to tackle inner demons which may get in the way of a full and enjoyable life.

    Stoicism is a philosophy geared towards living the best life possible for your own well being as well as that of others. Stoicism is not about cold detachment but about joyful engagement with your circumstances and freedom from anxiety and other negative emotions. Stoic ideas have never been more relevant than in our complex and ever-changing modern world.
      <br><br>
    Whether you're just curious or have been reading Epictetus, Seneca, and Marcus Aurelius for years, please come join us as we discuss our practices and share resources with each other to try to become a little bit better at living each day. Fellow travelers from other contemplative traditions such as Buddhism are more than welcome to share in this journey, too.

Each week we will choose a theme and dig in! Come bring your questions, curiosity or just join us for a relaxing night out of the house. Hope to see you there!

  name: Cape Town Chess
  description: |-
    Cape Town Chess is purely about relaxed social chess. There is no money involved. We are not an official chess club and we don’t keep score.
    <br><br>
    What we like most of all is to be the cause of a dormant chess player starting to re-learn the game and play semi-regularly again. We try to do this by way of a pleasant new social aspect to chess.
    <br><br>
    We are willing to get outside of our comfort zone and we try to be good losers. Remember that social chess is sometimes about giving your opponent a break, like some extra time or an encouraging word.
    <br><br>
    Don't worry, if you know how to play, you are good enough.

  name: Bird Watchers Rio
  description: |-
    The Bird Watchers Rio group enjoys getting out around Rio de Janeiro to photograph and discover the city's diverse bird life and any other nature we come across. We welcome people who are newly interested in birds just as much as experienced 'birders'. The aim is to get out to varied locations where you will have exposure to a good range of birds in the company of friendly, like-minded people.
    <br><br>
    You're just as welcome with a point and shoot as you are with a high-end camera attached to a telephoto zoom lens. Some people don't even have a camera and use the outings to get advice on a camera to buy and simply enjoy a day out in nature. What you take from the day is entirely up to you and we take our events at a casual, leisurely pace.

  name: Asian Philosophy Naples

    This group will gather to discuss Asian philosophy and poetry texts, with the aim of broadening our Western mindsets and discovering new ways of thinking. Whether you have read/studied some Asian philosophy/poetry before or are simply curious to explore it for the first time, you are more than welcome to join. All texts will be read in the English translation, but if you know how to speak or read in the original, feel free to read both.
    <br><br>
    The goal will be to speak in an experiential way about what these texts reveal to us, and how they enrich/intersect/challenge our lives. Some countries and traditions to be explored: Buddhism, Confucianism, Daoism, Shinto, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, etc. We will occasionally read secondary sources to help us approach the primary texts with greater ease.
